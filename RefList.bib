Het specificatieverband (interactie-effect) komt in het boek niet aan de orde. Ch. 2 geeft een helder overzicht over de manieren waarop variabelen gecontroleerd kunnen worden zodat directe, indirecte en schijnverbanden berekend kunnen worden: tabelelaboratie, effectanalyse en padanalyse, waarbij correlatie- en regressieanalyse als technieken vrij centraal staan. Oordeel: tamelijk geschikt om studenten na te laten denken over hun causale schema (binnen het conceptueel model - mbv Ch. 1) en hen een opstap te geven naar multivariate analyse (Ch. 2 en 3).

	abstract={Several attempts have already been made to interpret the well-established results of biometry in accordance with the Mendelian scheme of inheritance. It is here attempted to ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more general type than has hitherto been examined, inheritance in which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human variability. The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations σ1 and σ2, it is found that the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard deviation . It is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure of variability. We shall term this quantity the Variance of the normal population to which it refers, and we may now ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages of the total variance which they together produce. It is desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood, and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that loose phrases about the “percentage of causation,” which obscure the essential distinction between the individual and the population, should be carefully avoided.},

	note={ID: Frick1998},
	abstract={The standard textbook treatment of conventional statistical tests assumes random sampling from a population and interprets the outcome of the statistical testing as being about a population. Problems with this interpretation include that (1) experimenters rarely make any attempt to randomly sample, (2) if random sampling occurred, conventional statistical tests would not precisely describe the population, and (3) experimenters do not use statistical testing to generalize to a population. The assumption of random sampling can be replaced with the assumption that scores were produced by a process. Rejecting the null hypothesis then leads to a conclusion about process, applying to only the subjects in the experiment (e.g., that some difference in the treatment of two groups caused the difference in average scores). This interpretation avoids the problems noted and fits how statistical testing is used in psychology.},

Textbooks of psychological statistics and the psychological journal literature are reviewed to examine the presence of what Gigerenzer (1993) called a hybrid model of statistical testing. Such a model is present in the textbooks, although the mathematically incomplete character of this model precludes the appearance of a similarly hybridized approach to statistical testing in the research literature. The implications of this hybrid model for psychological research and the statistical testing controversy are discussed.},

	abstract={The main thesis of the paper is that in the case of modern statistics, the differences between the various concepts of models were the key to its formative controversies. The mathematical theory of statistical inference was mainly developed by Ronald A. Fisher, Jerzy Neyman, and Egon S. Pearson. Fisher on the one side and Neyman–Pearson on the other were involved often in a polemic controversy. The common view is that Neyman and Pearson made Fisher's account more stringent mathematically. It is argued, however, that there is a profound theoretical basis for the controversy: both sides held conflicting views about the role of mathematical modelling. At the end, the influential programme of Exploratory Data Analysis is considered to be advocating another, more instrumental conception of models.

	pages={143-155},
	abstract={We consider the problem of separating the direct effects of an exposure from effects relayed through an intermediate variable (indirect effects). We show that adjustment for the intermediate variable, which is the most common method of estimating direct effects, can be biased. We also show that, even in a randomized crossover trial of exposure, direct and indirect effects cannot be separated without special assumptions; in other words, direct and indirect effects are not separately identifiable when only exposure is randomized. If the exposure and intermediate never interact to cause disease and if intermediate effects can be controlled, that is, blocked by a suitable intervention, then a trial randomizing both exposure and the intervention can separate direct from indirect effects. Nonetheless, the estimation must be carried out using the G-computation algorithm. Conventional adjustment methods remain biased. When exposure and the intermediate interact to cause disease, direct and indirect effects will not be separable even in a trial in which both the exposure and the intervention blocking intermediate effects are randomly assigned. Nonetheless, in such a trial, one can still estimate the fraction of exposure-induced disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate. Even in the absence of an intervention blocking the intermediate effect, the fraction of exposure-inuced disease that could be prevented by control of the intermediate can be estimated with the G-computation algorithm if data are obtained on additional confounding variables.},

The two approaches are compared in this paper for the problem of estimating the mean of the finite population. Following some notes on the historical development, criteria for "best estimator" within each approach are discussed. These criteria are applied to a series of examples, which show that several of the classical results can be obtained and reinterpreted without difficulty through the model-based theory. The role of "artificial randomization" is discussed.

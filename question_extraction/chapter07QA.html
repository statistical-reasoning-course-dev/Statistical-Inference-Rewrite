As a consequence, a long <p> <p> red arrow contributes more to between-groups variance than two short arrows <p> <p> that are just as long as the long arrow if they are summed.

It accounts for 25 per cent of the differences in smoking attitude, which is quite a lot.    <p> <p> * Former smokers (*M* = -1.69, *SD* = 1.71) are significantly more negative towards smoking than smokers (*M* = 0.80, *SD* = 1.67) and non-smokers (*M* = 0.64, *SD* = 1.17). The differences with former smokers range from 1.7 to 3.3 points (on a scale with ten points) for smokers (average difference = -2.49, *p* < .001, 95% CI [-3.30, -1.68]) and from 1.7 to 3.0 points for non-smokers (average difference = -2.33, *p* < .001, 95% CI [-3.01, -1.65] in the population). <p> <p> * The difference between smokers and non-smokers is not statistically significant, although smokers seem to have a more positive rather than a more negative attitude towards smoking than non-smokers (average difference = 0.16, *p* = 1.000, 95% CI [-0.49, 0.81]).

The differences (beween <p> <p> females and males) are the same for all endorsers, so the endorser effect is <p> <p> the same for both sexes. There is no moderation. <p> <p> * The green arrows represent the differences between average willingness of <p> <p> males and females for one endorser.

What is or are the main effects in Figure \@ref(fig:anova-overview)? Explain how you can recognize main effects both in the means plot and in the table of means. [<img src="icons/2answer.png" width=115px align="right">](#answer7.7.1) <p><p> <A name="answer7.7.1"></A> <p> <p>  <p> <p> ```{block2, type='rmdanswer', echo=ch7} <p> <p> Answer to Question 1.  <p> <p>  <p> <p> * There are two factors as we can see in the table: endorser (columns) and sex (rows). Each factor has a main effect, so there are two main effects in this example. <p> <p>  <p> <p> ![](figures/S7_7Q1.png) <p> <p>  <p> <p> * A main effect exists if the groups on one factor have unequal means. <p> <p> * In the right-most column of the table, it is easy to see that females have a <p> <p> higher average willingness score (6.5) than males (5.0), so there is a main <p> <p> effect of sex. <p> <p> * The average scores for the three endorsers are also quite clearly different <p> <p> (bottom row of the table). <p> <p> * In the plot, the main effects are more difficult to see. You have to guess <p> <p> the average score of females over all endorsers (the average of the red line) <p> <p> and the average score of all males (average of the blue line), to see that <p> <p> females score higher than males on average. Well, the fact that the red line <p> <p> is consistently higher than the blue line also tells you the story. <p> <p>  <p> <p> ![](figures/S7_7Q1a.png) <p> <p>  <p> <p> * In addition, we have to guess the average score for each endorser from the <p> <p> plot. This is somewhere in the middle of the green arrow linking the score of <p> <p> females to the score of males for an endorser. The average score with Clooney <p> <p> as endorser seems to be higher than the average score without a celebrity <p> <p> endorser, and the average score for Angelina Jolie is highest. These <p> <p> differences indicate a main effect for endorser.

Change some group means to create substantial and statistically significant moderation of the effect of endorser (Nobody, Clooney, or Jolie) on willingness. [<img src="icons/2answer.png" width=115px align="right">](#answer7.7.2) <p><p> <A name="answer7.7.2"></A> <p> <p>  <p> <p> ```{block2, type='rmdanswer', echo=ch7} <p> <p> Answer to Question 2.  <p> <p>  <p> <p> * An interaction effect is best understood as different effects of one factor <p> <p> (predictor) across different groups on another factor (moderator). In this <p> <p> example, we use endorser as predictor and sex as moderator. The red line shows us the effect of the predictor (endorser) for females. The effect is a <p> <p> difference in average willingness scores for different endorsers. The <p> <p> differences are visualized by the lines that link two means, for example, with Jolie as endorser, willingness to donate is higher than without a celebrity endorser. <p> <p>  <p> <p> ![](figures/S7_7Q2.png) <p> <p>  <p> <p> * In the initial situation, the endorser effects are equal for females (red <p> <p> lines) and males (blue lines): the Jolie versus Nobody difference (in <p> <p> average willingness) is the same for females and males because the red and <p> <p> blue lines have the same slopes. The lines are parallel. <p> <p> * This is also reflected by the fact that the difference between average <p> <p> female and male willingness for the Nobody endorser (the green arc) is the <p> <p> same as the difference for Jolie as endorser. The differences (beween <p> <p> females and males) are the same for all endorsers, so the endorser effect is <p> <p> the same for both sexes. There is no moderation. <p> <p> * The green arrows represent the differences between average willingness of <p> <p> males and females for one endorser. If the green arrows are not equally long <p> <p> or point in opposite directions, the differences between females and males are not the same for all endorsers. <p> <p> * Change the score of one or more subgroups (sex - endorser combinations) in <p> <p> the table until the _p_ value of the interaction effect is below .05. Now, the interaction effect is statistically significant at the .05 level. <p> <p>  <p> <p> ![](figures/S7_7Q2a.png) <p> <p>  <p> <p> * In this situation, sex moderates the effect of endorser on willingness or, <p> <p> equivalently, endorser moderates the effect of sex on willingness. The <p> <p> differences in willingness to donate between females and males are not the <p> <p> same for all three endorsers. In analysis of variance, moderation can be <p> <p> understood as different differences.

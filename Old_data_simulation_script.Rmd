# Notes

# PDF output:
#* Embedded shiny apps: Lots of whitespace within the screenshot. Helps to define out.height in chunk - no. cliprect = 'viewport' does not work. selector = "#sampling-distribution-summary1" does not work. vwidth=420, vheight=620 does not work. Setting dev="png" works even though some whitespace remains under the app. Specify out.width (to get a caption) but don't specify out.height (increases the app size).
#* Interactive network visualizations (flow chart in 4.2 Formulating Statistical Hypotheses, mediation models in 9.6 Path Model with Regression Analysis) badly captured (due to fig.asp="50%"?) with lots of whitespace (and of course no link to interactive version). Adding out.width and/or out.height seems to create new problems (mean-centering of consecutive text, caption rendered as LaTex...). Manual screenshots shown with screenshot.alt = "".
#* No screen shots for videos embedded with iframe (4.2.9 Comparing Means in SPSS). Also, a separate figure caption is not numbered. Solved by embedding them with knitr::include_url and dev = "png" but this puts videos in a floating context, so they are no longer in the Instructions section in the PDF. 
#* Manually adjust .tex file: replace \begin{figure} by \begin{figure}[H]. Also apply to tables to stop them from floating. Manual screenshots of videos (with correct file names) in figures\videoshots. Copy all to _book\GentleIntro_files\figure-latex and recompile .tex file. Note: Also copy all files in figure-latex directory from _bookdown_files\GentleIntro_files  to the _book\GentleIntro_files.
#* Including a manual screen shot with screenshot.alt = "" solves the white-space problem but it does not add a link to the interactive content (shiny app). Only applicable to dynamic networks that have no link anyhow.

#* Only caption to figure if out.width is set.
#* kable tables are not adjusted to the page margins (see 2.5.2 Conditions for the use of theoretical probability distributions, 9.6.3 Partial and full mediation). out.width="100%" does not help.

#* Equations: use aligned instead of align. But aligned does not work in HTML - need different package to render equations in HTML? 
#* Equations are numbered with the section number. The number is not displayed with the equation itself.

#* HTML table to arrange text and pictures does not work: 2.1 (baron), 3.5.1 (Neyman), 5.2 (metal detector), 5.3.1 (Pearson), 6.3.2 (Gauss, LaPlace). Size of picture must be made explicit. Embed with knitr::include_graphics and set output.width? Note that include_graphics makes the picture float, which is not what I want with portraits. Also, the dpi seems to matter to eventual out.width of r chunck with include_graphics.

# Links to external resources such as (SPSS) data must be absolute. They cannot be stored in the R Markdown doc root directory, so I store them in a data subdirectory of the shiny server http://82.196.4.233:3838/data. Embed links as HTML with target="_blank" to open the resource in a new window otherwise the Shiny server displays the R Markdown document in grey (must be reloaded).

# Include SPSS tabular output:
#- Right-click table, select Style Output, Select as Group (Continue), Table Look, Compact.
#- Select tales to be exported. Don't select separate analysis titles, they are badly formatted.
#- Right-click selected table and export as HTML, Change Options: Export visible layer only, Export without styling, Include footnotes and captions, Export visible view only.
#- Export HTML file to R project directory.
#- Include HTML file in R Markdown within <iframe>. Set width="100%" and experiment to find the right height.
# Note that html content embedded in this way yields problems with webshot capturing if the document is knitted into PDF.

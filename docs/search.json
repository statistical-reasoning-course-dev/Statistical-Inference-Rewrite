    "text": "Introduction and Reader’s Guide\nThis book offers a non-technical but thorough introduction to statistical inference. It discusses a minimal set of concepts needed to understand both the possibilities and pitfalls of estimation, null hypothesis testing, moderation, and mediation analysis. It uses a minimum of formal notation.\n\nIntended Audience and Setting\nThis book is written as reading material for a follow-up course in statistics, in the bachelor of Communication Science at the University of Amsterdam. Students enrolled in this course have passed an introductory course in statistics that explained how to change research questions into variables and associations between variables, how to select and execute the correct analysis or test (in SPSS) to answer their research question, and how to interpret the results in a language that is both comprehensible for the average reader and complying with professional standards (APA standard for reporting test results). In addition, they have learned the very basics of inferential statistics: How to decide which null hypothesis to reject based on reported p values, and how to interpret confidence intervals.\nThis book is meant for use in a flipped-classroom setting. Students should read the text, watch embedded videos, and play with the interactive content before they meet in class. Class meetings are used to answer questions raised by the students, do group work to exercise with the concepts and techniques presented in the text, and do short tests to check understanding.\n\n\nInteractive Content\nThe interactive content in this book replaces simulations that used to be demonstrated during lectures. I expect that doing simulations yourself rather than watching them being done by someone else enhances understanding. I have tried to break down the simulations into smaller steps, confronting the student several times with essentially the same simulation, but with added complexity. I hope that this approach enhances understanding and remembrance and, at the same time, avoids frustration caused by complex dashboards offering all options at once.",

    "text": "Summary\nWatch this micro lecture on sampling distributions for an overview of the chapter.\nWhat does our sample tell us about the population from which it was drawn?\nStatistical inference is about estimation and null hypothesis testing. We have collected data on a random sample and we want to draw conclusions (make inferences) about the population from which the sample was drawn. From the proportion of yellow candies in our sample bag, for instance, we want to estimate a plausible range of values for the proportion of yellow candies in a factory’s stock (confidence interval). Alternatively, we may want to test the null hypothesis that one fifth of the candies in a factory’s stock is yellow.\nThe sample does not offer a perfect miniature image of the population. If we would draw another random sample, it would have different characteristics. For instance, it would contain more or fewer yellow candies than the previous sample. To make an informed decision on the confidence interval or null hypothesis, we must compare the characteristic of the sample that we have drawn to the characteristics of the samples that we could have drawn.\nThe characteristics of the samples that we could have drawn constitute a sampling distribution. Sampling distributions are the central element in estimation and null hypothesis testing. In this chapter, we simulate sampling distributions to understand what they are. Here, simulation means that we let a computer draw many random samples from a population.\nIn Communication Science, we usually work with samples of human beings, for instance, users of social media, people looking for health information or entertainment, citizens preparing to cast a political vote, an organization’s stakeholders, or samples of media content such as tweets, tv advertisements, or newspaper articles. In the current and two subsequent chapters, however, we avoid the complexities of these samples.\nWe focus on a very tangible kind of sample, namely a bag of candies, which helps us understand the basic concepts of statistical inference: sampling distributions (the current chapter), probability distributions (Chapter Chapter 2), and estimation (Chapter ?sec-param-estim). Once we thoroughly understand these concepts, we turn to Communication Science examples.",

    "text": "1.1 Statistical Inference: Making the Most of Your Data\nStatistics is a tool for scientific research. It offers a range of techniques to check whether statements about the observable world are supported by data collected from that world. Scientific theories strive for general statements, that is, statements that apply to many situations. Checking these statements requires lots of data covering all situations addressed by theory.\nCollecting data, however, is expensive, so we would like to collect as little data as possible and still be able to draw conclusions about a much larger set. The cost and time involved in collecting large sets of data are also relevant to applied research, such as market research. In this context we also like to collect as little data as necessary.\nInferential statistics offers techniques for making statements about a larger set of observations from data collected for a smaller set of observations. The large set of observations about which we want to make a statement is called the population. The smaller set is called a sample. We want to generalize a statement about the sample to a statement about the population from which the sample was drawn.\nTraditionally, statistical inference is generalization from the data collected in a random sample to the population from which the sample was drawn. This approach is the focus of the present book because it is currently the most widely used type of statistical inference in the social sciences. We will, however, point out other approaches in Chapter ?sec-hypothesis.\nStatistical inference is conceptually complicated and for that reason quite often used incorrectly. We will therefore spend quite some time on the principles of statistical inference. Good understanding of the principles should help you to recognize and avoid incorrect use of statistical inference. In addition, it should help you to understand the controversies surrounding statistical inference and developments in the practice of applying statistical inference that are taking place. Investing time and energy in fully understanding the principles of statistical inference really pays off later.",

    "section": "1.2 A Discrete Random Variable: How Many Yellow Candies in My Bag?",
    "text": "1.2 A Discrete Random Variable: How Many Yellow Candies in My Bag?\nAn obvious but key insight in statistical inference is this: If we draw random samples from the same population, we are likely to obtain different samples. No two random samples from the same population need to be identical, even though they can be identical.\n\n1.2.1 Sample statistic\nWe are usually interested in a particular characteristic of the sample rather than in the exact nature of each observation within the sample. For instance, I happen to be very fond of yellow candies. If I buy a bag of candies, my first impulse is to tear the bag open and count the number of yellow candies. Am I lucky today? Does my bag contain a lot of yellow candies?\n\n\n\n\nThe number of yellow candies in a bag is an example of a sample statistic: a value describing a characteristic of the sample. Each bag, that is, each sample, has one outcome score on the sample statistic. For instance, one bag contains four yellow candies, another bag contains seven, and so on. All possible outcome scores constitute the sampling space. A bag of ten candies may contain 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 yellow candies. The numbers 0 to 10 are the sampling space of the sample statistic number of yellow candies in a bag.\nThe sample statistic is called a random variable. It is a variable because different samples can have different scores. The value of a variable may vary from sample to sample. It is a random variable because the score depends on chance, namely the chance that a particular sample is drawn.\n\n\n1.2.2 Sampling distribution\nSome sample statistic outcomes occur more often than other outcomes. We can see this if we draw very many random samples from a population and collect the frequencies of all outcome scores in a table or chart. We call the distribution of the outcome scores of very many samples a sampling distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Probability and probability distribution\nWhat is the probability of buying a bag with exactly five yellow candies? In statistical terminology, what is the probability of drawing a sample with five yellow candies as sample statistic outcome? This probability is the proportion of all possible samples that we could have drawn that happen to contain five yellow candies.\nOf course, the probability of a sample bag with exactly five yellow candies depends on the share of yellow candies in the population of all candies. Figure ?fig-probability-distribution displays the probabilities of a sample bag with a particular number of yellow candies if twenty per cent of the candies in the population are yellow. You can adjust the population share of yellow candies to see what happens.\n\n\n\n\nThe sampling distribution tells us all possible samples that we could have drawn. We can use the distribution of all samples to get the probability of buying a bag with exactly five yellow candies from the sampling distribution: We divide the number of samples with five yellow candies by the total number of samples we have drawn. For example, if 26 out of all 1000 samples have five yellow candies, the proportion of samples with five yellow candies is 26 / 1000 = 0.026. Then, the probability of drawing a sample with five yellow candies is 0.026 (we usually write: .026).\nIf we change the frequencies in the sampling distribution into proportions, we obtain the probability distribution of the sample statistic: A sampling space with a probability (between 0 and 1) for each outcome of the sample statistic. Because we are usually interested in probabilities, sampling distributions tend to have proportions, that is probabilities, instead of frequencies on the vertical axis. See Figure ?fig-expected-value for an example.\nFigure ?fig-probability-distribution displays the probability distribution of the number of yellow candies per bag of ten candies. This is an example of a discrete probability distribution because only a limited number of outcomes are possible. It is feasible to list the probability of each outcome separately.\nThe sampling distribution as a probability distribution conveys very important information. It tells us which outcomes we can expect, in our example, how many yellow candies we may find in our bag of ten candies. Moreover, it tells us the probability that a particular outcome may occur. If the sample is drawn from a population in which 20% of candies are yellow, we are quite likely to find zero, one, two, three, or four yellow candies in our bag. A bag with five yellow candies would be rare, six or seven candies would be very rare, and a bag with more than seven yellow candies is extremely unlikely but not impossible. If we buy such a bag, we know that we have been extremely lucky.\nWe may refer to probabilities both as a proportion, that is, a number between 0 and 1, and as a percentage: a number between 0% and 100%. Proportions are commonly considered to be the correct way to express probabilities. When we talk about probabilities, however, we tend to use percentages; we may, for example, say that the probabilities are fifty-fifty.\n\n\n1.2.4 Expected value or expectation\nWe haven’t yet thought about the value that we are most likely to encounter in the sample that we are going to draw. Intuitively, it must be related to the distribution of colours in the population of candies from which the sample was drawn. In other words, the share of yellow candies in the factory’s stock from which the bag was filled or in the machine that produces the candies, seems to be relevant to what we may expect to find in our sample.\n\n\n\n\nIf the share of yellow candies in the population is 0.20 (or 20%), we expect one out of each five candies in a bag (sample) to be yellow. In a bag with 10 candies, we would expect two candies to be yellow: one out of each five candies or the population proportion times the total number of candies in the sample = 0.20 * 10 = 2.0. This is the expected value.\nThe expected value of the proportion of yellow candies in the sample is equal to the proportion of yellow candies in the population. If you carefully inspect a sampling distribution (Figure ?fig-expected-value), you will see that the expected value also equals the mean of the sampling distribution. This makes sense: Excess yellow candies in some bags must be compensated for by a shortage in other bags.\nThus we arrive at the definition of the expected value of a random variable:\n\n\n\nThe expected value is the average of the sampling distribution of a random variable.\n\n\nIn our example, the random variable is a sample statistic, more specifically, the number of yellow candies in a sample.\nThe sampling distribution is an example of a probability distribution, so, more generally, the expected value is the average of a probability distribution. The expected value is also called the expectation of a probability distribution.\n\n\n1.2.5 Unbiased estimator\nNote that the expected value of the proportion of yellow candies in the bag (sample statistic) equals the true proportion of yellow candies in the candy factory (population statistic). For this reason, the sample proportion is an unbiased estimator of the proportion in the population. More generally, a sample statistic is called an unbiased estimator of the population statistic if the expected value (mean of the sampling distribution) is equal to the population statistic. By the way, we usually refer to the population statistic as a parameter.\nMost but not all sample statistics are unbiased estimators of the population statistic. Think, for instance, of the actual number of yellow candies in the sample. This is certainly not an unbiased estimator of the number of yellow candies in the population. Because the population is so much larger than the sample, the population must contain many more yellow candies than the sample. If we were to estimate the number in the population (the parameter) from the number in the sample—for instance, we estimate that there are two yellow candies in the population of all candies because we have two in our sample of ten—we are going to vastly underestimate the number in the population. This estimate is downward biased: It is too low.\nIn contrast, the proportion in the sample is an unbiased estimator of the population proportion. That is why we do not use the number of yellow candies to generalize from our sample to the population. Instead, we use the proportion of yellow candies. You probably already did this intuitively.\nSometimes, we have to adjust the way in which we calculate a sample statistic to get an unbiased estimator. For instance, we must calculate the standard deviation and variance in the sample in a special way to obtain an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation and variance. The exact calculation need not bother us, because our statistical software takes care of that. Our software only uses unbiased estimators.\n\n\n1.2.6 Representative sample\nBecause the share of yellow candies in the population represents the probability of drawing a yellow candy, we also expect 20% of the candies in our bag to be yellow. For the same reason we expect the shares of all other colours in our sample bag to be equal to their shares in the population. As a consequence, we expect a random sample to resemble the population from which it is drawn.\nA sample is representative of a population (in the strict sense) if variables in the sample are distributed in the same way as in the population. Of course, we know that a random sample is likely to differ from the population due to chance, so the actual sample that we have drawn is usually not representative of the population in the strict sense.\nBut we should expect it to be representative, so we say that it is in principle representative or representative in the statistical sense of the population. We can use probability theory to account for the misrepresentation in the actual sample that we draw. This is what we do when we use statistical inference to construct confidence intervals and test null hypotheses, as we will learn in later chapters.",

    "section": "1.3 A Continuous Random Variable: Overweight And Underweight.",
    "text": "1.3 A Continuous Random Variable: Overweight And Underweight.\nLet us now look at another variable: the weight of candies in a bag. The weight of candies is perhaps more interesting to the average consumer than candy colour because candy weight is related to calories.\n\n1.3.1 Continuous variable\nWeight is a continuous variable because we can always think of a new weight between two other weights. For instance, consider two candy weights: 2.8 and 2.81 grams. It is easy to see that there can be a weight in between these two values, for instance, 2.803 grams. Between 2.8 and 2.803 we can discern an intermediate value such as 2.802. In principle, we could continue doing this endlessly, e.g., find a weight between 2.80195661 and 2.80195662 grams even if our scales may not be sufficiently precise to measure any further differences. It is the principle that counts. If we can always think of a new value in between two values, the variable is continuous.\n\n\n\nContinuous variable: We can always think of a new value in between two values.\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Continuous sample statistic\nWe are not interested in the weight of a single candy. If a relatively light candy is compensated for by a relatively heavy candy in the same bag, we still get the calories that we want. We are interested in the average weight of all candies in our sample bag, so average candy weight in our sample bag is our key sample statistic. We want to say something about the probabilities of average candy weight in the samples of candies that we can draw. Can we do that?\nWhen we turn to the probabilities of getting samples with a particular average candy weight, we run into problems with a continuous sample statistic. If we would want to know the probability of drawing a sample bag with an average candy weight of 2.8 grams, we should exclude sample bags with an average candy weight of 2.81 grams, or 2.801 grams, or 2.8000000001 grams, and so on. In fact, we are very unlikely to draw a sample bag with an average candy weight of exactly 2.8 grams, that is, with an infinite number of zeros trailing 2.8. In other words, the probability of such a sample bag is for all practical purposes zero and negligible.\nThis applies to every average candy weight, so all probabilities are virtually zero. The probability distribution of the sampling space, that is, of all possible outcomes, is going to be very boring: just (nearly) zeros. And it will take forever to list all possible outcomes within the sampling space, because we have an infinite number of possible outcomes. After all, we can always find a new average candy weight between two selected weights.\n\n\n1.3.3 Probability density\nWith a continuous sample statistic, we must look at a range of values instead of a single value. We can meaningfully talk about the probability of having a sample bag with an average candy weight of at least 2.8 grams or at most 2.8 grams. We choose a threshold, in this example 2.8 grams, and determine the probability of values above or below this threshold. We can also use two thresholds, for example the probability of an average candy weight between 2.75 and 2.85 grams. This is probably what you were thinking of when I referred to a bag with 2.8 grams as average candy weight.\nIf we cannot determine the probability of a single value, which we used to depict on the vertical axis in a plot of a sampling distribution, and we have to link probabilities to a range of values on the x axis, for example, average candy weight above/below 2.8 grams, how can we display probabilities? We have to display a probability as an area between the horizontal axis and a curve. This curve is called a probability density function, so if there is a label to the vertical axis of a continuous probability distribution, it is “Probability density” instead of “Probability”.\nFigure ?fig-p-values shows an example of a continuous probability distribution for the average weight of candies in a sample bag. This is the familiar normal distribution so we could say that the normal curve is the probability density function here. The total area under this curve is set to one, so the area belonging to a range of sample outcomes (average candy weight) is 1 or less, as probabilities should be.\n\n\n\n\nA probability density function can give us the probability of values between two thresholds. It can also give us the probability of values up to (and including) a threshold value, which is known as a left-hand probability, or the probability of values above (and including) a threshold value, which is called a right-hand probability. In a null hypothesis significance test (Chapter ?sec-hypothesis), right-hand and left-hand probabilities are used to calculate p values.\nWhy did I put (and including) between parentheses? It does not really matter whether we add the exact boundary value (2.8 grams) to the probability on the left or on the right because the probability of getting a bag with average candy weight at exactly 2.8 grams (with a very long trail of zero decimals) is negligible.\nAre you struggling with the idea of areas instead of heights (values on the vertical axis) as probabilities? Just realize that we could use the area of a bar in a histogram instead of the height as indication of the probability in discrete probability distributions, for example, Figure ?fig-expected-value. The bars in a histogram are all equally wide, so (relative) differences between bar areas are equal to differences in bar height.\n\n\n1.3.4 Probabilities always sum to 1\nWhile you were playing with Figure ?fig-p-values, you may have noticed that displayed probabilities always add up to one. This is true for every probability distribution because it is part of the definition of a probability distribution.\nIn addition, you may have realized that we can use probability distributions in two ways. We can use them to say how likely or unlikely we are to draw a sample with the sample statistic value in a particular range. For example, what is the chance that we draw a sample bag with average candy weight over 2.9 grams? But we can also use a probability distribution to find the threshold values that separate the top ten per cent or the bottom five per cent in a distribution. If we want a sample bag with highest average candy weight, say, belonging to the ten per cent bags with highest average candy weight, what should be the minimum average candy weight in the sample bag?",

    "section": "1.4 Concluding Remarks",
    "text": "1.4 Concluding Remarks\nA communication scientist wants to know whether children are sufficiently aware of the dangers of media use. On a media literacy scale from one to ten, an average score of 5.5 or higher is assumed to be sufficient.\nIf we translate this to the simple candy bag example, we realize that the outcome in our sample does not have to be the true population value, for example twenty per cent. If twenty per cent of all candies in the population are yellow, we could very well draw a sample bag with fewer or more than twenty per cent yellow candies.\nAverage media literacy, then, can exceed 5.5 in our sample of children, even if average media literacy is below 5.5 in the population or the other way around. How we decide on this is discussed in later chapters.\n\n1.4.1 Sample characteristics as observations\nPerhaps the most confusing aspect of sampling distributions is the fact that samples are our cases (units of analysis) and sample characteristics are our observations. We are accustomed to think of observations as measurements on empirical things such as people or candies. We perceive each person or each candy as a case and we observe a characteristic that may change across cases (a variable), for instance the colour or weight of a candy.\nIn a sampling distribution, however, we observe samples (cases) and measure a sample statistic as the (random) variable. Each sample adds one observation to the sampling distribution and its sample statistic value is the value added to the sampling distribution.\n\n\n1.4.2 Means at three levels\nIf we are dealing with the proportion of yellow candies in a sample (bag), the sample statistic is a proportion and we want to know the proportion of yellow candies in the population. The sampling distribution collects a large number of sample proportions. The mean of the proportions in the sampling distribution (expected value) equals the proportion of yellow candies in the population, because a sample proportion is an unbiased estimator of the population proportion.\nThings become a little confusing if we are interested in a sample mean, such as the average weight of candies in a sample bag. Now we have means at three levels: the population, the sampling distribution, and the sample.\n\n\n\n\nThe sampling distribution, here, is a distribution of sample means but the sampling distribution itself also has a mean, which is called the expected value or expectation of the sampling distribution. Don’t let this confuse you. The mean of the sampling distribution is the average of the average weight of candies in every possible sample bag. This mean of means has the same value as our first mean, namely the average weight of the candies in the population because a sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean.\nRemember this: The population and the sample consist of the same type of observations. In the current example, we are dealing with a sample and a population of candies. In contrast, the sampling distribution is based on a different type of observation, namely samples, for example, sample bags of candies.\nThe sampling distribution is the crucial link between the sample and the population. On the one hand the sampling distribution is connected to the population because the population statistic (parameter), for example, average weight of all candies, is equal to the mean of the sampling distribution. On the other hand, it is linked to the sample because it tells us which sample means we will find with what probabilities. We need the sampling distribution to make statements about the population based on our sample.",

    "text": "2.1 Exact Approaches to the Sampling Distribution\nThe first approach we will discuss to constructing a sampling distribution has implicitly been demonstrated in the section on probability distributions (Section ?sec-probdistribution). In this section, we calculated the true sampling distribution of the proportion of yellow candies in a sample from the probabilities of the colours. If we know or think we know the proportion of yellow candies in the population, we can exactly calculate the probability that a sample of ten candies includes one, two, three, or ten yellow candies. See the section on discrete random variables for details (Section ?sec-discreterandomvariable).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe calculated probabilities of all possible sample statistic outcomes give us an exact approach to the sampling distribution. Note that I use the word approach instead of approximation here because the obtained sampling distribution is no longer an approximation, that is, more or less similar to the true sampling distribution. No, it is the true sampling distribution itself.\n\n2.1.1 Exact approaches for categorical data\nAn exact approach lists and counts all possible combinations. This can only be done if we work with discrete or categorical variables. For an unlimited number of categories (continues variables), we cannot list all possible combinations.\nA proportion is based on frequencies and frequencies are discrete (integer values), so we can use an exact approach to create a sampling distribution for one proportion such as the proportion of yellow candies in the example above. The exact approach uses the binomial probability formula to calculate probabilities. Consult the internet if you want to know this formula; we are not going to use it in this course.\nExact approaches are also available for the association between two categorical (nominal or ordinal) variables in a contingency table: Do some combinations of values for the two variables occur relatively frequently? For example, are yellow candies more often sticky than red candies? If candies are either sticky or not sticky and they have one out of a limited set of colours, we have two categorical variables. We can create an exact probability distribution for the combination of colour and stickiness. The Fisher-exact test is an example of an exact approach to the sampling distribution of the association between two categorical variables.\n\n\n2.1.2 Computer-intensive\nThe exact approach can be applied to discrete variables because they have a limited number of values. Discrete variables are usually measured at the nominal or ordinal level. If the number of categories becomes large, a lot of computing time can be needed to calculate the probabilities of all possible sample statistic outcomes. Exact approaches are said to be computer-intensive.\nIt is usually wise to set a limit to the time you allow your computer to work on an exact sampling distribution because otherwise the problem may keep your computer occupied for hours or days. In this course, we will set the time limit in SPSS on 5 minutes (section ?sec-Exact Approaches in SPSS.",

    "text": "2.2 Exact Approaches in SPSS\n\n2.2.1 Introduction\nTo perform an exact approach in SPSS, let us set an example for a research. In a preceding paragraph we suggested the question are yellow candies more often sticky than red candies? If we want to investigate this, we have two variables. The first variable is candy colour (yellow versus red) and the second variable is stickiness (sticky versus not sticky). Thus, these two variables are both categorical (with two categories).\nWe can create an exact probability distribution for the combination of colour and stickiness.\nIf SPSS offers an exact approach of the sampling distribution, the test dialog window contains an Exact button. You will find this in the dialog window for contingenxy table (Analyze &gt; descriptive statistics &gt; crosstabs) and in several legacy dialogs for non-parametric tests (Analyze &gt; nonparametric tests &gt; legacy diologs). In the Exact dialog, you check the Exact option and SPSS automatically sets an upper limit of five minutes to the execution of the command. You can leave this at five minutes.\nAs established, we have two categorical variables with two groups. Looking at the test selection table, we know that we use a Chi Square test to investigate these variables. Thus, within the dialog window contingency tables we select Chi-sqaure in the Statistics dialog and the option Exact in the Exact dialog.\nNote a Fisher’s exact test is automatically run when there is a 2x2 contingency table, when we perform this test on larger contingency tables we need to select the Exact option, which is why we teach it to you here.\n\n\n2.2.2 Instructions",

    "section": "2.3 Theoretical Approximations of the Sampling Distribution",
    "text": "2.3 Theoretical Approximations of the Sampling Distribution\nBecause bootstrapping and exact approaches to the sampling distribution require quite a lot of computing power, these methods were not practical in the not so very distant pre-computer age. In those days, mathematicians and statisticians discovered that many sampling distributions look a lot like known mathematical functions. For example, the sampling distribution of the sample mean can be quite similar to the well-known bell-shape of the normal distribution or the closely related (Student) t distribution. The mathematical functions are called theoretical probability distributions. Most statistical tests use a theoretical probability distribution as approximation of the sampling distribution.\n\n\n\n\nThe normal distribution is a mathematical function linking continuous scores, e.g., a sample statistic such as the average weight in the sample, to right-hand and left-hand probabilities, that is, to the probability of finding at least, or at most, this score. Such a function is called a probability density function (Section ?sec-cont-random-var).\nWe like to use a theoretical probability distribution as an approximation of the sampling distribution because it is convenient. A computer can calculate probabilities from the mathematical function very quickly. We also like theoretical probability distributions because they usually offer plausible arguments about chance and probabilities.\n\n2.3.1 Reasons for a bell-shaped probability distribution\nThe bell shape of the normal distribution makes sense. Our sample of candies is just as likely to be too heavy, as it is too light, so the sampling distribution of the sample mean should be symmetrical. A normal distribution is symmetrical.\nIn addition, it is more likely that our sample bag has an average weight that is near the true average candy weight in the population than an average weight that is much larger or much smaller than the true average. Bags with on average extremely heavy or extremely light candies may occur, but they are extremely rare (we are very lucky or very unlucky). From these intuitions we would expect a bell shape for the sampling distribution.\nFrom this argumentation, we conclude that the normal distribution is a reasonable model for the probability distribution of sample means. Actually, it has been proven that the normal distribution exactly represents the sampling distribution in particular cases, for instance the sampling distribution of the mean of a very large sample.\n\n\n2.3.2 Conditions for the use of theoretical probability distributions\nTheoretical probability distributions, then, are plausible models for sampling distributions. They are known or likely to have the same shape as the true sampling distributions under particular circumstances or conditions.\nIf we use a theoretical probability distribution, we must assume that the conditions for its use are met. We have to check the conditions and decide whether they are close enough to the ideal conditions. Close enough is of course a matter of judgement. In practice, rules of thumb have been developed to decide if the theoretical probability distribution can be used.\nFigure ?fig-normal-approx-proportion shows an example in which the normal distribution is a good approximation for the sampling distribution of a proportion in some situations, but not in all situations.\n\n\n\n\nDo theoretical probability distributions fit the true sampling distribution? As you may have noticed while playing with Figure ?fig-normal-approx-proportion, this is not always the case. In general, theoretical probability distributions fit sampling distributions better if the sample is larger. In addition, the population value may be relevant to the fit of the theoretical probability distribution. The sampling distribution of a sample proportion is more symmetrical, like the normal distribution, if the proportion in the population is closer to .5.\nThis illustrates that we often have several conditions for a theoretical probability distribution to fit the sampling distribution. We should evaluate all of them at the same time. In the example of proportions, a large sample is less important if the true proportion is closer to .5 but it is more important for true proportions that are more distant from .5.\nThe rule of thumb for using the normal distribution as the sampling distribution of a sample proportion combines the two aspects by multiplying them and requiring the resulting product to be larger than five. If the probability of drawing a yellow candy is .2 and our sample size is 30, the product is .2 * 30 = 6, which is larger than five. So we may use the normal distribution as approximation of the sampling distribution.\nNote that this rule of thumb uses one minus the probability, if the probability is larger than .5. In other words, it uses the smaller of two probabilities: the probability that an observation has the characteristic and the probability that it has not. For example, if we want to test the probability of drawing a candy that is not yellow, the probability is .8 and we use 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, which is then multiplied by the sample size.\nApart from the normal distribution, there are several other theoretical probability distributions. We have the binomial distribution for a proportion, the t distribution for one or two sample means, regression coefficients, and correlation coefficients, the F distribution for comparison of variances and comparing means for three or more groups (analysis of variance, ANOVA), and the chi-squared distribution for frequency tables and contingency tables.\nFor most of these theoretical probability distributions, sample size is important. The larger the sample, the better. There are additional conditions that must be satisfied such as the distribution of the variable in the population. The rules of thumb are summarized in Table (tab-thumb?). Bootstrapping and exact tests can be used if conditions for theoretical probability distributions have not been met. Special conditions apply to regression analysis (see Chapter ?sec-moderationcat, Section ?sec-regr-inference).\nTable (tab-thumb?) shows the conditions that must be satisfied if we want to use a theoretical probability distribution to approximate a sampling distribution. Only if the conditions are met, the theoretical probability distribution resembles the sampling distribution sufficiently.\nIn Table (tab-thumb?) the minimal required sample sizes for using theoretical approximation of sampling distributions are presented. If you plan to do a t test, each group should contain more than thirty cases. So if you intend to apply t tests, recruit more than thirty participants for each experimental group or more than thirty respondents for each group in your survey. If you expect non-response, that is, sampled participants or respondents unwilling to participate in your research, you should recruit more participants or respondents to have more than thirty observations in the end.\nChi-squared tests require a minimum of five expected frequencies per category in a frequency distribution or cell in a contingency table. Your sample size should be at least the number of categories or cells times five to come even near this requirement. Regression analysis requires at least 20 cases per independent variable in the regression model.\nThe variation of sample size across groups is important in analysis of variance (ANOVA), which uses the F distribution. If the number of cases is more or less the same across all groups, we do not have to worry about the variances of the dependent variable for the groups in the population. To be on the safe side, then, it is recommended to design your sampling strategy in such a way that you end up with more or less equal group sizes if you plan to use analysis of variance.\n\n\n2.3.3 Checking conditions\nRules of thumb about sample size are easy to check once we have collected our sample. By contrast, rules of thumb that concern the scores in the population cannot be easily checked, because we do not have information on the population. If we already know what we want to know about the population, why would we draw a sample and do the research in the first place?\nWe can only use the data in our sample to make an educated guess about the distribution of a variable in the population. For example, if the scores in our sample are clearly normally distributed, it is plausible that the scores in the population are normally distributed.\nIn this situation, we do not know that the population distribution is normal but we assume it is. If the sample distribution is clearly not normally distributed, we had better not assume that the population is normally distributed. In short, we sometimes have to make assumptions when we decide on using a theoretical probability distribution.\nWe could use a histogram of the scores in our sample with a normal distribution curve added to evaluate whether a normal distribution applies. Sometimes, we have statistical tests to draw inferences about the population from a sample that we can use to check the conditions. We discuss these tests in a later chapter.\n\n\n2.3.4 More complicated sample statistics: differences\nUp to this point, we have focused on rather simple sample statistics such as the proportion of yellow candies or the average weight of candies in a sample. Table (tab-thumb?), however, contains more complicated sample statistics.\nIf we compare two groups, for instance, the average weight of yellow and red candies, the sample statistic for which we want to have a sampling distribution must take into account both the average weight of yellow candies and the average weight of red candies. The sample statistic that we are interested in is the difference between the averages of the two samples.\n\n\n\n\nIf we draw a sample from both the red and yellow candies in the population, we may calculate the means for both samples and the difference between the two means. For example, the average weight of red candies in the sample bag is 2.76 grams and the average for yellow candies is 2.82 grams. For this pair of samples, the statistic of interest is 2.76 - 2.82 = -0.06, that is, the difference in average weight. If we repeat this many, many times and collect all differences between means in a distribution, we obtain the sampling distribution that we need.\nThe sampling distribution of the difference between two means is similar to a t-distribution, so we may use the latter to approximate the former. Of course, the conditions for using the t-distribution must be met.\nIt is important to note that we do not create separate sampling distributions for the average weight of yellow candies and for the average weight of red candies and then look at the difference between the two sampling distributions. Instead, we create one sampling distribution for the statistic of interest, namely the difference between means. We cannot combine different sampling distributions into a new sampling distribution. We will see the importance of this when we discuss mediation (Chapter ?sec-mediation).\n\n\n2.3.5 Independent samples\nIf we compare two means, there are two fundamentally different situations that are sometimes difficult to distinguish. When comparing the average weight of yellow candies to the average weight of red candies, we are comparing two samples that are statistically independent (see Figure ?fig-mean-independent), which means that we could have drawn the samples separately.\nIn principle, we could distinguish between a population of yellow candies and a population of red candies, and sample yellow candies from the first population and separately sample red candies from the other population. Whether we sampled the colours separately or not does not matter. The fact that we could have done so implies that the sample of red candies is not affected by the sample of yellow candies or the other way around. The samples are statistically independent.\nThis is important for the way in which probabilities are calculated. Just think of the simple example of flipping two coins. The probability of having heads twice in a row is .5 times .5, that is .25, if the coins are fair and the result of the second coin does not depend on the result of the first coin. The second flip is not affected by the first flip.\nImagine that a magnetic field is activated if the first coin lands with heads up and that this magnetic field increases the odds that the second coin will also be heads. Now, the second toss is not independent of the first toss and the probability of getting heads twice is larger than .25.\n\n\n2.3.6 Dependent samples\nThe example of a manipulated second toss is applicable to repeated measurements. If we want to know how quickly the yellow colour fades when yellow candies are exposed to sun light, we may draw a sample of yellow candies once and measure the colourfulness of each candy at least twice: at the start and end of some time interval. We compare the colourfulness of a candy at the second measurement to its colourfulness at the first measurement.\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, we are comparing two means, just like the yellow versus red candy weight example, but now the samples for both measurements are the same. It is impossible to draw the sample for the second measurement independently from the sample for the first measurement if we want to compare repeated measurements. Here, the second sample is fixed once we have drawn the first sample. The samples are statistically dependent; they are paired samples.\nWith dependent samples, probabilities have to be calculated in a different way, so we need a special sampling distribution. In the interactive content above, you may have noticed a relatively simple solution for two repeated measurements. We just calculate the difference between the two measurements for each candy in the sample and use the mean of this new difference variable as the sample statistic that we are interested in. The t-distribution, again, offers a good approximation of the sampling distribution of dependent samples if the samples are not too small.\nFor other applications, the actual sampling distributions can become quite complicated but we do not have to worry about that. If we choose the right technique, our statistical software will take care of this.",

    "section": "2.5 The Bootstrap Approximation of the Sampling Distribution",
    "text": "2.5 The Bootstrap Approximation of the Sampling Distribution\nThe first way to obtain a sampling distribution is still based on the idea of drawing a large number of samples. However, we only draw one sample from the population for which we collect data. As a next step, we draw a large number of samples from our initial sample. The samples drawn in the second step are called bootstrap samples. The technique was developed by Bradley Efron (1979; 1987). For each bootstrap sample, we calculate the sample statistic of interest and we collect these as our sampling distribution. We usually want about 5,000 bootstrap samples for our sampling distribution.\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure ?fig-bootstrapping, an initial sample (left panel) has been drawn from a population containing five candy colours in equal proportions.\n\n\n\nThe bootstrap concept refers to the story in which Baron von Münchhausen saves himself by pulling himself and his horse by his bootstraps (or hair) out of a swamp. In a similar miraculous way, bootstrap samples resemble the sampling distribution even though they are drawn from a sample instead of the population. This miracle requires some explanation and it does not work always, as we will discuss in the remainder of this section.\nPicture: Baron von Münchhausen pulls himself and his horse out of a swamp. Theodor Hosemann (1807-1875), public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n2.5.1 Sampling with and without replacement\nAs we will see in Chapter ?sec-param-estim, for example Section ?sec-precisionsesamplesize, the size of a sample is very important to the shape of the sampling distribution. The sampling distribution of samples with twenty-five cases can be very different from the sampling distribution of samples with fifty cases. To construct a sampling distribution from bootstrap samples, the bootstrap samples must be exactly as large as the original sample.\nHow can we draw many different bootstrap samples from the original sample if each bootstrap sample must contain the same number of cases as the original sample?\n\n\n\n\nIf we allow every case in the original sample to be sampled only once, each bootstrap sample contains all cases of the original sample, so it is an exact copy of the original sample. Thus, we cannot create different bootstrap samples.\nBy the way, we often use the type of sampling described above, which is called sampling without replacement. If a person is (randomly) chosen for our sample, we do not put this person back into the population so she or he can be chosen again. We want our respondents to fill out our questionnaire only once or participate in our experiment only once.\nIf we do allow the same person to be chosen more than once, we sample with replacement. The same person can occur more than once in a sample. Bootstrap samples are sampled with replacement from the original sample, so one bootstrap sample may differ from another. Some cases in the original sample may not be sampled for a bootstrap sample while other cases are sampled several times. You probably have noticed this in Figure ?fig-replacement. Sampling with replacement allows us to obtain different bootstrap samples from the original sample, and still have bootstrap samples of the same size as the original sample.\nIn conclusion, we sample bootstrap samples in a different way (with replacement) than participants for our research (without replacement).\n\n\n2.5.2 Limitations to bootstrapping\nDoes the bootstrapped sampling distribution always reflect the true sampling distribution?\n\n\n\n\nWe can create a sampling distribution by sampling from our original sample with replacement. It is hardly a miracle that we obtain different samples with different sample statistics if we sample with replacement. Much more miraculous, however, is that this bootstrap distribution resembles the true sampling distribution that we would get if we draw lots of samples directly from the population.\nDoes this miracle always happen? No. The original sample that we have drawn from the population must be more or less representative of the population. The variables of interest in the sample should be distributed more or less the same as in the population. If this is not the case, the sampling distribution may give a distorted view of the true sampling distribution. This is the main limitation to the bootstrap approach to sampling distributions.\nA sample is more likely to be representative of the population if the sample is drawn in a truly random fashion and if the sample is large. But we can never be sure. There always is a chance that we have drawn a sample that does not reflect the population well.\n\n\n2.5.3 Any sample statistic can be bootstrapped\nThe big advantage of the bootstrap approach (bootstrapping) is that we can get a sampling distribution for any sample statistic that we are interested in. Every statistic that we can calculate for our original sample can also be calculated for each bootstrap sample. The sampling distribution is just the collection of the sample statistics calculated for all bootstrap samples.\nBootstrapping is more or less the only way to get a sampling distribution for the sample median, for example, the median weight of candies in a sample bag. We may create sampling distributions for the wildest and weirdest sample statistics, for instance the difference between sample mean and sample median squared. I would not know why you would be interested in the squared difference of sample mean and median, but there are very interesting statistics that we can only get at through bootstrapping. A case in point is the strength of an indirect effect in a mediation model (Chapter ?sec-mediation).",
